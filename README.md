# CIS_410_Assignment4_Fall2024
Write a brief description of the results and include that in the body of the README.md file.

In JupyterLab, I read the data from the exams.csv file into a DataFrame and displayed the first five rows in order to analyze the data.
Using the info() method, I was able to see that the data has 3 int64 and 5 object data types. For the describe() method, I was able to see the statistical information for the math, reading, and writing scores. While analyzing the exam data, I created box plots using pandas to show the outliers between all scores and seaborn to create a scatter plot, relational plot, and categorical plot to compare data between the reading and writing scores. I also displayed single column information for the reading score, parental level of education, and lunch.
